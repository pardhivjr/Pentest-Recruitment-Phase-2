.pyc files are compiled Python files.
Compilation process generates .pyc files, that are bytecode files.

The .pyc file is converted to .py file.
```import dis
with open ('chall.pyc','rb') as f:
     bytecode = f.read()
dis.dis(bytecode)
```

Uncompyle6 can also be used
python -m uncompyle6 -o . <fileName.pyc>  

DECOMPILED .PY FILE:
```def modify_string(input_str):
    modified_str = ''
    for i in range(len(input_str)):
        char = input_str[i]
        if i % 2 == 0:
            modified_str += chr(ord(char) - 3)
        else:
            modified_str += chr(ord(char) + 2)

    return modified_str


def main():
    user_input = input('Enter a string: ')
    modified_input = modify_string(user_input)
    target_string = 'cn^ixelomkigaam{qjlp<Az'
    if modified_input == target_string:
        print('Congratulations! You got the correct modified string.')
    else:
        print("Sorry, the modified string doesn't match the target.")


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

ANALYSIS OF CODE:
An input is prompted.
the input is modified in a certain way and matched with a target string.
So, modified string== target string.
Intially the target string is converted to ascii and the following operations are done:
Since we move in the reverse manner to find the input, the steps should also be reversed.
in EVEN INDICES,its ASCII -3 and in ODD INDICES its ASCII +2 .
1st char of target string is c which corresponds to 99 in ASCII.So 3 is added to 99 which makes it 102 which corresponds to f.

The (-) and (+) when reversed in the py file, when inputted with the targeted string can give us the input.
